      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        GUMI (グミ) is a Japanese VOCALOID developed and distributed by Internet Co., Ltd. as Megpoid (メグッポイド) which was initially released in June 2009 for the VOCALOID2 engine. There have since been three installments developed for the VOCALOID3 engine: an update of the VOCALOID2 voice bank, additional Japanese voice libraries serving as an expansion pack, and a new bank dedicated to the English language. Her Japanese voicebanks were updated to the VOCALOID4 engine in November 2015, while for the VOCALOID6 engine, she released as a Japanese AI vocal in October 2022, which allowed her to use the "Multilingual" function to sing in English and Mandarin Chinese without the need for recording fully dedicated voicebanks to each language.[1] In July 2024, GUMI received an extension to her AI Megpoid voicebank, AI Megpoid SOLID, also for the VOCALOID6 engine.[2][3]
        In January 2014, GUMI received a speech voicebank known as Megpoid Talk. She later received a speech voicebank for A.I.VOICE in September 2022.[4] In June 2024, GUMI received an update to her A.I.VOICE voicebank for A.I.VOICE2.[5][6]
        in December 2023, GUMI received an AI voice database for Synthesizer V Studio, developed by AH-Software Co. Ltd. but distributed by Internet. An update for Synthesizer V Studio 2 has released in September 2025.[7]
        Her voice is provided by Filipino-Japanese singer and voice actress Megumi Nakajima (中島愛; Nakajima Megumi).

      <h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
      <p>
        The original avatar character of the software was drawn by Masami Yuuki (ゆうきまさみ Yuuki Masami). Her design is often said to be influenced by Ranka Lee's character (one of the first roles done by Megumi Nakajima as a seiyuu). Ranka Lee's main outfit (which she wears for the notable song "Seikan Hikou") contains the colors green, yellow, and orange. This has never been officially confirmed, but is still a popular assumption with both Japanese and overseas VOCALOID fans. Her illustrations from her debut VOCALOID2 software, through her VOCALOID3 releases including: V3 Megpoid, Native, English and up until her VOCALOID4 Megpoid V4 voicebanks had all been illustrated by Masami Yuuki. As of VOCALOID6, a new illustrator, Nou, has taken over the role acting as her official illustrator and has provided illustrations for her AI Megpoid and AI Megpoid SOLID voicebanks.
        Her belt buckle incorporates the Tenori-on device's design.
        Concerning GUMI's age, during the V3 Extend development, Noboru once tweeted that there was a rough age preferred for GUMI set around the teenage years. However, no official age was given to GUMI in her designs. When writing about Extend, it was noted the voice could be considered 'extensions' of the age conceptualized for GUMI.[9]
        Across all designs, GUMI is generally depicted as a young woman with shoulder-length emerald green hair with short choppy bangs, and energetic green eyes. Her fingernails and toenails are painted orange.

      <h2>REPUTATION</h2>
      <p>
        GUMI struggled to build popularity against the Character Vocal Series and was considered to be "nothing special" when first released. She was, however, quicker to gain popularity in comparison to Camui Gackpo.[13]
        By 2010, GUMI's popularity was on par with Crypton Future Media's voicebanks and outsold her predecessor Gackpo, becoming the most popular and well known non-Crypton VOCALOID. In 2011, her usage grew and, in a number of weeks, she would have even more songs in the top 100 rankings than some of the Crypton Future Media vocalists.
        Half a year since its release, Noboru Murakami, the president of Internet Co., announced that AI Megpoid sold well, even outselling all of GUMI's other libraries, including her complete VOCALOID4 package. He noted that there were more purchases via music stores than ever before, and half of the sales were starter packs.[14]

      <h2>IMPACT</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of contributions to VOCALOID history, Camui Gackpo's voice provider, Gackt, noted that the creation of Gackpo and GUMI allowed for the possibility of other providers being used for VOCALOID. VOCALOID was no longer just Hatsune Miku and the Kagamines. This influenced voice providers such as Madoka Yonezawa, who during the early era of the software wanted to one day make a VOCALOID. This was later achieved with Kizuna Akari who was both a VOCALOID and a VOICEROID product. Yonezawa noted that at the time, the field of voice acting was narrow with limited job choices and VOCALOID added another possibility to the career path.[16]
